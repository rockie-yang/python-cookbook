Python is one of my favorite together with Scala/C/C++/Lua.
I have using Python for some small application for quite while.
But I have never systematically studied Python.

It's quite a treasure that I got some spare time to study something I want.
So I decided to spend some time on Python.
I started with a book <Python Cookbook> by David M. Beazley.
I might dig into deep to some algorithm or python internal later on.

I wish I could know most detail related to Python.
Extend my general software development knowledge.
Get a bit inside of Python.

I will experience anything on the book myself. Study similar topics with the book.
Every code will be written in python files.
Those python files will be converted into markdown files by my own hand written python application.

Then those markdown file will be published on gitbook.com.

The main reasons for me record it down and published in gitbook are:
    > To follow my study process.
    > To practise my English.
    > To reference later on.
    > To other people might interested.
